        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up with this chicken and rice casserole recipe. 
                My Grandmother got it from a lady from church at a pot 
                luck a long time ago! She passed it down to my mom and 
                it's always been a family favorite. Quick and easy for 
                school nights, and the leftovers are just as good! You 
                can use less butter on top of course, my Momma and Mamaw 
                always put the full stick on top (gotta love Southern 
                ladies and their butter!)
            </p>
            <p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                    Grease sides and bottom of a casserole dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir chicken, water, rice, cream of chicken soup, 
                    cream of celery soup, and cream of mushroom soup 
                    together in the prepared casserole dish; season with 
                    salt and pepper. Arrange butter evenly over the top 
                    of the chicken mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven until the rice is tender and the 
                    chicken is cooked through, 1 hour to 75 minutes. Cool 10 
                    to 15 minutes before serving.
