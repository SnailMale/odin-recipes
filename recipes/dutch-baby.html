        <h2>Desription</h2>
            <p>
                You're in for a huge treat with this blueberry 
                studded baked pancake--it's rich and satisfying 
                but surprisingly light tasting. The true magic 
                of a Dutch baby is the contrast of texture between 
                the crispy, crusty outside and the soft, custardy, 
                fruity center. This version is not only gorgeous and 
                delicious, but it's fun and simple to make! There's 
                no sugar in the batter, so all the sweetness comes 
                from the berries and the powdered sugar. For a sweeter 
                version, serve with maple syrup like regular blueberry pancakes.

            Steps
        </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine flour, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and milk 
                    in a high-speed blender. Blend on high speed until 
                    completely smooth and very thin, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a 9- or 10-inch cast iron skillet over high heat. 
                    Pour clarified butter into the skillet and use a pastry 
                    brush to grease the sides. Heat butter until just 
                    starting to smoke.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quickly and carefully pour the batter into the center of 
                    the skillet, then sprinkle blueberries over top. Transfer 
                    skillet to the center of the preheated oven and bake until 
                    browned and nicely puffed, 20 to 25 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully remove from the oven and immediately brush the 
                    top with melted butter. Squeeze lemon juice over top as 
                    Dutch baby deflates. Dust with powdered sugar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut in wedges to serve and drizzle with maple syrup.
                </li>
